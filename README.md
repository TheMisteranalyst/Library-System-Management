who have issued at least one book in the last 1 YEAR.
```sql
CREATE TABLE active_members
AS
SELECT * FROM members
WHERE member_id IN (SELECT
                    DISTINCT issued_member_id
					FROM issued_status
					WHERE 
					issued_date>= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL'1YEAR'
                    );
```

### Task 17: Find Employees with the Most Book Issues Processed
Write a query to find the top 3 employees who have processed the most book issues.
Display the employee name, number of books processed, and their branch.

```sql
SELECT 
    e.emp_name,
    b.*,
    COUNT(ist.issued_id) as no_book_issued
FROM issued_status as ist
JOIN
employees as e
ON e.emp_id = ist.issued_emp_id
JOIN
branch as b
ON e.branch_id = b.branch_id
GROUP BY 1, 2;
```
### Task 18: Identify Members Issuing High-Risk Books
Write a query to identify members who have issued books more than twice with the status "damaged" in the books table. 
Display the member name, book title, and the number of times they've issued damaged books.

```sql
SELECT * FROM books

SELECT * FROM return_status
SELECT * FROM members
SELECT * FROM issued_status


SELECT 
    DISTINCT
	m.member_name,
    b.book_title,
    COUNT(ist.issued_id) AS no_books_issued
FROM 
    issued_status AS ist
JOIN
    members AS m
ON 
    m.member_id = ist.issued_member_id
JOIN
    books AS b
ON 
    ist.issued_book_isbn = b.isbn
LEFT JOIN 
    return_status AS rs
ON 
    rs.issued_id = ist.issued_id
WHERE 
    rs.book_quality ='Damaged'  
GROUP BY 
    m.member_name, b.book_title
HAVING 
    COUNT(ist.issued_id) >2;
```
### Task 19: Stored Procedure Objective: 
Create a stored procedure to manage the status of books in a library system.Description: Write a stored procedure that updates the status of a book in the library based on its issuance. The procedure should function as follows: The stored procedure should take the book_id as an input parameter. The procedure should first check if the book is available (status = 'yes').If the book is available, it should be issued, and the status in the books table should be updated to 'no'. If the book is not available (status = 'no'), the procedure should return an error message indicating that the book is currently not available.	
This project highlights my ability to work with databases and solve practical challenges through robust and efficient SQL implementations.
```sql
SELECT * FROM issued_status;
SELECT * FROM books;

CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE issue_book_status(p_issued_id VARCHAR(10),p_issued_member_id VARCHAR(10),
p_issued_book_isbn VARCHAR(30),p_issued_emp_id VARCHAR(10))
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
DECLARE 
       v_status VARCHAR(10);
	   v_title VARCHAR(80);

BEGIN
      SELECT status,book_title 
	  INTO v_status,v_title 
	  FROM books
	  WHERE isbn=p_issued_book_isbn;

	  IF v_status ='yes' THEN
	               INSERT INTO issued_status(issued_id,issued_member_id,issued_book_name,issued_date,issued_book_isbn,issued_emp_id)
	               VALUES
	                 (p_issued_id,p_issued_member_id,v_title,CURRENT_DATE,p_issued_book_isbn,p_issued_emp_id);
                   UPDATE books
                   SET status='no'
                   WHERE isbn=p_issued_book_isbn;
      
      RAISE NOTICE 'Book records added successfully for book ISBN: %, Title: %', p_issued_book_isbn, v_title;

	  ELSE
	       RAISE NOTICE 'Sorry! The book you have requested is unavailable. ISBN: %, Title: %', p_issued_book_isbn, v_title;


	  END IF;
END;
$$

### Task 20: Create Table As Select (CTAS) Objective: 
Create a CTAS (Create Table As Select) query to identify overdue books and calculate fines.
Description: Write a CTAS query to create a new table that lists each member and the books they have issued but not returned within 60 days. The table should include: The number of overdue books. The total fines, with each day's fine calculated at $0.50. The number of books issued by each member. The resulting table should show: Member ID Number of overdue books Total fines
```sql
CREATE TABLE overdue_books_summary AS
SELECT
    m.member_id,
    m.member_name,
    COUNT(*) AS overdue_books,
    SUM(CASE WHEN CURRENT_DATE - ist.issued_date > 60 AND rs.return_date IS NULL THEN 
        (CURRENT_DATE - ist.issued_date - 60) * 0.50 ELSE 0 END) AS total_fines
FROM issued_status AS ist
JOIN members AS m
ON ist.issued_member_id = m.member_id
LEFT JOIN return_status AS rs
ON ist.issued_id = rs.issued_id
WHERE rs.return_date IS NULL
AND (CURRENT_DATE - ist.issued_date) >= 60
GROUP BY m.member_id;

select * from overdue_books_summary
```
